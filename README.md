# 3D Models

Collection of self-designed 3D models made for FDM 3D-printing.

## Usage
The included makefile takes care of building this file. It can also generate STL models from [SolveSpace](https://solvespace.com) and [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) project sources.

- `make` to generate all
- `make readme` to generate this file
- `make freecad` to export FreeCAD projects to STL meshes
- `make solvespace` to export SolveSpace projects to STL meshes
- `make clean` to clean all.
